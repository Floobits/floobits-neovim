TROUBLESHOOTING

To increase the logging level, add "let floo_log_level = 'debug'" to your
vimrc.

Other plugins can interfere with Floobits. For example, YouCompleteMe changes
updatetime to 2000 milliseconds. This causes increased latency and decreased
reliability when collaborating. If you experience problems, try disabling
other plugins before submitting a bug report.
