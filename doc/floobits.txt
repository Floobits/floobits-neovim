:FlooJoinWorkspace [url]    Joins a Floobits workspace. URLs look like
                            https://floobits.com/owner/workspace_name/
                            workspace urls are the same as what you see in the
                            web editor.

                                                *FlooShareDirPublic*
:FlooShareDirPublic [path]  Shares a directory with others. This will create a
                            new workspace if one doesn't already exist. When
                            done, the workspace's settings will open in your
                            browser.

:FlooShareDirPrivate [path] Same as FlooShareDirPublic, but with workspace
                            permissions restricted to the owner. Others cannot
                            view the workspace.

                                                *FlooToggleFollowMode*
:FlooToggleFollowMode       Follow mode follows the most recent change in a
                            workspace.

                                                *FlooSummon*
:FlooSummon                 Force everyone else in the workspace to jump to your
                            cursor.

                                                *FlooRefreshWorkspace*
:FlooRefreshWorkspace       Scan local workspace copy for changes and prompt to
                            overwrite local/remote if files differ. Useful after
                            switching branches in git.

TROUBLESHOOTING

To increase the logging level, add '"debug": true' to your ~/.floorc.json

Other plugins can interfere with Floobits. For example, YouCompleteMe changes
updatetime to 2000 milliseconds. This causes increased latency and decreased
reliability when collaborating. If you experience problems, try disabling
other plugins before submitting a bug report.
